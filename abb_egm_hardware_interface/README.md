# abb_egm_hardware_interface

**Please note that this package has not been productized, and that academia is the intended audience.**\
**The package is provided "as-is", and as such no more than limited support can be expected.**

## Overview

The `abb_egm_hardware_interface` package provides:

- A `ros_control`-based hardware interface, for communicating with ABB robots via the *Externally Guided Motion* (`EGM`) interface:
  - Recommendations:
    - Use `RobotStudio` simulations before testing with real robots.
    - Use the latest supported `RobotWare` version to get the best `EGM` performance.
  - The hardware interface sets up `EGM` servers that the robot can send feedback messages to, and receive motion commands from:
    - It is always the robot that initiates `EGM` communication sessions.
  - The hardware interface will only allow `ros_control` controllers to be started if there is already an active `EGM` communication session:
    - Users can specify a list of controllers that are always ok to start (*e.g. passive state controllers*).
  - For `MultiMove` systems it is important to note that:
    - The ROS side configurations must specify correct names for the mechanical unit groups that are intended to be used with `EGM`.
    - Activation/deactivation of mechanical units, after the hardware interface has been initialized, is not handled by the hardware interface and can lead to unexpected behavior.
- A ROS node that uses the hardware interface, together with a `ros_control` controller manager, to run a control loop.
- A ROS node for stopping `ros_control` controllers when `EGM` sessions ends:
  - Users can specify a list of controllers that are ok to keep running (*e.g. passive state controllers*).

**Please note that this package is only recommended for advanced users.**

Please see the [egm_hardware_interface.launch](launch/egm_hardware_interface.launch) file for how to start the node and available node parameters. Additionally, the ROS node, provided by the `abb_rws_service_provider` package, is required during initialization of the hardware interface.

Please see the [config](config) folder for configuration examples for a few different use cases.

### Requirements

- `RobotWare` version `7.0` or higher.

Please see the underlying [abb_libegm](https://github.com/ros-industrial/abb_libegm) and [abb_librws](https://github.com/ros-industrial/abb_librws) packages for more details.

### Troubleshooting

*The following table is non-exhaustive, but it should at least give some ideas for things to check.*

| Issue | Check |
|  --- | --- |
| Communication | If the `FlexPendant` shows the `No data from UdpUc device` message it means that the robot sent out `EGM` `UDP` messages, but it did not receive any reply:<br><ul><li>Verify that the correct remote IP-address, and port number, has been specified in the the robot's system configurations: *`RobotStudio` > Controller tab > Configuration > Communication > Transmission Protocol* (check the `UDPUC` instances).</li><li>Verify that no firewall is blocking `UDP` communication on the desired ports.</li></ul> |
| Utilization rate | If the hardware interface prints messages about an `EGM` channel's utilization rate being above `100%`, it means that the desired commands sent by the user are too aggressive and they should be reduced. |
| Motion (*robot side settings*) | System configurations:<ul><li>See *`RobotStudio` > Controller tab > Configuration > Motion > External Motion Interface Data* (the `Filtering`/`Raw` level can for example affect how well references are tracked).</li></ul>Important `EGM` `RAPID` parameters:<ul><li>The `\MaxSpeedDeviation` parameter can be used to trim acceleration/deceleration, and it also seems to limit the maximum allowed joint speed (*ROS side velocity limits should be less than or equal to this this parameter*).</li><li>Pure velocity control requires the `\PosCorrGain` parameter to be set to `0`.</li><li>Make sure that the correct `tooldata` has be specified in the `RAPID` code with either `\Tool` or `\TLoad` (*i.e. if modal payload mode is set to `No` in the system configurations*).</li><li>If the `RobotWare` [StateMachine Add-In](https://robotapps.robotstudio.com/#/viewApp/c163de01-792e-4892-a290-37dbe050b6e1) is present, and if the ROS node provided by the `abb_rws_service_provider` package is used, then ROS services are exposed to get/set the `EGM` `RAPID` settings directly from the ROS side.</li></ul>*Please see the *Application manual - Externally Guided Motion* (*document ID: `3HAC073319-001`, revision: `B`*) for a more detailed description of `EGM` settings and capabilities.* |
| Motion (*ROS side settings*) | The hardware interface registers `PositionJointSoftLimitsInterface` and `VelocityJointSoftLimitsInterface` interfaces, which users can, for example, configure with velocity limits for each joint (*conservative limits are set per default*).<br><br>*Please see the [joint_limits_interface](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/wiki/joint_limits_interface) package for more details about how joint limit configurations can be specified.*</li></ul></li></ul> |
