# abb_rws_service_provider

**Please note that this package has not been productized, and that academia is the intended audience.**\
**The package is provided "as-is", and as such no more than limited support can be expected.**

## Overview

The `abb_rws_service_provider` package provides a ROS node that:

1. Attempts to connect to an ABB robot controller via the *Robot Web Services* (`RWS`) interface.
2. Collects information from the controller about the current system, for example:
   - `RobotWare` version and present options.
   - Configured mechanical unit groups (*e.g. robots and external axes*).
   - Configured `RAPID` tasks.
3. Exposes a set of ROS services for interacting with the controller from the ROS system.

Some of the exposed ROS services include:

- Basic interaction:
  - Setting motors on/off.
  - Starting/stopping `RAPID` execution.
  - Getting/setting of `RAPID` symbols (*e.g. constants and variables*):
    - Atomic `RAPID` data types: `bool`, `dnum`, `num` and `string`.
    - Complex `RAPID` data structures (*i.e. `RECORD`s, and these are currently only get/set via raw `RAPID` text format*).
  - Getting/setting of file contents (*of files in the robot controller's home directory*).
  - Getting/setting speed ratio for `RAPID` motions.
  - Getting/setting of IO-signals.
- `RobotWare` [StateMachine Add-In](https://github.com/Amin173/statemachine_add_in_rw7) interaction (*only exposed if the `StateMachine Add-In` is present in the system*):
  - `RAPID` interaction:
    - Setting custom `RAPID` routines to run (*the routines needs to be predefined in the `RAPID` code*).
    - Signaling that the custom `RAPID` routines should be run.
  - *Externally Guided Motion* (`EGM`) interaction (*only exposed if the `EGM` option is present*):
    - Getting/setting `EGM` `RAPID` settings.
    - Starting/stopping `EGM` joint or pose motions.
    - Starting/stopping `EGM` position streaming (*i.e. without controlling motions*).
  - `SmartGripper` interaction (*only exposed if the `SmartGripper` option is present*):
    - Setting commands to run (*e.g. grip in/out or turn on/off vacuum*).
    - Signaling that the commands should be run.

Please see the [rws_service_provider.launch](launch/rws_service_provider.launch) file for how to start the node and available node parameters. Additionally, the ROS node, provided by the `abb_rws_state_publisher` package, is required for most of the service calls.

### Requirements

- `RobotWare` version `7.0` or higher.

Please see the underlying [abb_libegm](https://github.com/ros-industrial/abb_libegm) and [abb_librws](https://github.com/Amin173/abb_librws.git) packages for more details.

### Troubleshooting

*The following table is non-exhaustive, but it should at least give some ideas for things to check.*

| Issue | Check |
|  --- | --- |
| Authentication | The node is currently hardcoded to use the default `RWS` login (`Default User` and `robotics`), but this can be changed in the [code](src/rws_service_provider.cpp#L106-L107) if needed. |
| Communication | Verify that the correct IP-address has been specified for the robot controller, and that it can be reached on the network:<br><ol><li>Using `ping <IP-address>`.</li><li>Using a web browser with `http://<IP-address>/rw?debug=1`, which will show a login prompt if connected (*e.g. use the default login above*).</li></ol> |
| `RobotStudio` | `RobotStudio` simulations blocks remote `RWS` connections by default, which is shown by the `RAPI Unidentified Error` message (*e.g. when using a web browser*).<br><br>*Please see this [post](https://forums.robotstudio.com/discussion/12082/using-robotwebservices-to-access-a-remote-virtual-controller) on the official `RobotStudio` forum for how to allow remote `RWS` connections.* |
| ROS Services | Verify that resource names are correctly spelled, for example:<br><ul><li>IO-signal name.</li><li>`RAPID` task, module and symbol names.</li><li>File name.</li><li>Etc.</li></ul>*Please note that most of the exposed services, that sets resources, requires auto mode to be active.* |
